# Hangman 
* A simple hangman game in C++ with a selection of 200 words for the user to guess from. Shell based game using ascii art to display the hangman.
## Project Feature and Goals
* A counter of how many guesses it takes
* a constantly updated drawing of the hangman for each guess
* a method of entering such that if the user wants to guess the word it is a completely different pathway and if guessed wrong, ends the game
## UI and Logic Planning
Hangman is a shell and text based game.
